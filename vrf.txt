                   Verifiable Random Functions (VRFs)
                         draft-irtf-cfrg-vrf-05

Abstract

   A Verifiable Random Function (VRF) is the public-key version of a
   keyed cryptographic hash.  Only the holder of the private key can
   compute the hash, but anyone with public key can verify the
   correctness of the hash.  VRFs are useful for preventing enumeration
   of hash-based data structures.  This document specifies several VRF
   constructions that are secure in the cryptographic random oracle
   model.  One VRF uses RSA and the other VRF uses Eliptic Curves (EC).

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Rationale

   A Verifiable Random Function (VRF) [MRV99] is the public-key version
   of a keyed cryptographic hash.  Only the holder of the private VRF
   key can compute the hash, but anyone with corresponding public key
   can verify the correctness of the hash.

   A key application of the VRF is to provide privacy against offline
   enumeration (e.g. dictionary attacks) on data stored in a hash-based
   data structure.  In this application, a Prover holds the VRF private
   key and uses the VRF hashing to construct a hash-based data structure
   on the input data.  Due to the nature of the VRF, only the Prover can
   answer queries about whether or not some data is stored in the data
   structure.  Anyone who knows the public VRF key can verify that the
   Prover has answered the queries correctly.  However no offline
   inferences (i.e. inferences without querying the Prover) can be made
   about the data stored in the data strucuture.

1.2.  Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.3.  Terminology

   The following terminology is used through this document:

   SK:  The private key for the VRF.

   PK:  The public key for the VRF.

   alpha or alpha_string:  The input to be hashed by the VRF.

   beta or beta_string:  The VRF hash output.

Internet-Draft                     VRF                       August 2019


   pi or pi_string:  The VRF proof.

   Prover:  The Prover holds the private VRF key SK and public VRF key
      PK.

   Verifier:  The Verifier holds the public VRF key PK.

2.  VRF Algorithms

   A VRF comes with a key generation algorithm that generates a public
   VRF key PK and private VRF key SK.

   The prover hashes an input alpha using the private VRF key SK to
   obtain a VRF hash output beta

      beta = VRF_hash(SK, alpha)

   The VRF_hash algorithm is deterministic, in the sense that it always
   produces the same output beta given a pair of inputs (SK, alpha).
   The prover also uses the private key SK to construct a proof pi that
   beta is the correct hash output

      pi = VRF_prove(SK, alpha)

   The VRFs defined in this document allow anyone to deterministically
   obtain the VRF hash output beta directly from the proof value pi as

      beta = VRF_proof_to_hash(pi)

   Notice that this means that

      VRF_hash(SK, alpha) = VRF_proof_to_hash(VRF_prove(SK, alpha))

   and thus this document will specify VRF_prove and VRF_proof_to_hash
   rather than VRF_hash.

   The proof pi allows a Verifier holding the public key PK to verify
   that beta is the correct VRF hash of input alpha under key PK.  Thus,
   the VRF also comes with an algorithm

      VRF_verify(PK, alpha, pi)

   that outputs (VALID, beta = VRF_proof_to_hash(pi)) if pi is valid,
   and INVALID otherwise.

3.  VRF Security Properties

   VRFs are designed to ensure the following security properties.

3.1.  Full Uniqueness or Trusted Uniqueness

   Uniqueness means that, for any fixed public VRF key and for any input
   alpha, there is a unique VRF output beta that can be proved to be
   valid.  Uniqueness must hold even for an adversarial Prover that
   knows the VRF private key SK.

   More precisely, "full uniqueness" states that a computationally-
   bounded adversary cannot choose a VRF public key PK, a VRF input
   alpha, and two proofs pi1 and pi2 such that VRF_verify(PK, alpha,
   pi1) outputs (VALID, beta1), VRF_verify(PK, alpha, pi2) outputs
   (VALID, beta2), and beta1 is not equal to beta2.

   A slightly weaker security property called "trusted uniqueness"
   sufficies for many applications.  Trusted uniqueness is the same as
   full uniqueness, but it must hold only if the VRF keys PK and SK were
   generated in a trustworthy manner.  In other words, uniqueness might
   not hold if keys were generated in an invalid manner or with bad
   randomness.

3.2.  Full Collison Resistance or Trusted Collision Resistance

   Like any cryprographic hash function, VRFs need to be collision
   resistant.  Collison resistance must hold even for an adversarial
   Prover that knows the VRF private key SK.

   More precisely, "full collision resistance" states that it should be
   computationally infeasible for an adversary to find two distinct VRF
   inputs alpha1 and alpha2 that have the same VRF hash beta, even if
   that adversary knows the private VRF key SK.

   For most applications, a slightly weaker security property called
   "trusted collision resistance" suffices.  Trusted collision
   resistance is the same as collision resistance, but it holds only if
   PK and SK were generated in a trustworthy manner.

3.3.  Full Pseudorandomness or Selective Pseudorandomness

   Pseudorandomness ensures that when an adversarial Verifier sees a VRF
   hash output beta without its corresponding VRF proof pi, then beta is
   indistinguishable from a random value.

   More precisely, suppose the public and private VRF keys (PK, SK) were
   generated in a trustworthy manner.  Pseudorandomness ensures that the



Goldberg, et al.        Expires February 9, 2020                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                     VRF                       August 2019


   VRF hash output beta (without its corresponding VRF proof pi) on any
   adversarially-chosen "target" VRF input alpha looks indistinguishable
   from random for any computationally bounded adversary who does not
   know the private VRF key SK.  This holds even if the adversary also
   gets to choose other VRF inputs alpha' and observe their
   corresponding VRF hash outputs beta' and proofs pi'.

   With "full pseudorandomness", the adversary is allowed to choose the
   "target" VRF input alpha at any time, even after it observes VRF
   outputs beta' and proofs pi' on a variety of chosen inputs alpha'.

   "Selective pseudorandomness" is a weaker security property which
   suffices in many applications.  Here, the adversary must choose the
   target VRF input alpha independently of the public VRF key PK, and
   before it observes VRF outputs beta' and proofs pi' on inputs alpha'
   of its choice.

   It is important to remember that the VRF output beta does not look
   random to the Prover, or to any other party that knows the private
   VRF key SK!  Such a party can easily distinguish beta from a random
   value by comparing beta to the result of VRF_hash(SK, alpha).

   Also, the VRF output beta does not look random to any party that
   knows valid VRF proof pi corresponding to the VRF input alpha, even
   if this party does not know the private VRF key SK.  Such a party can
   easily distinguish beta from a random value by checking whether
   VRF_verify(PK, alpha, pi) returns (VALID, beta).

   Also, the VRF output beta may not look random if VRF key generation
   was not done in a trustworthy fashion.  (For example, if VRF keys
   were generated with bad randomness.)

3.4.  A random-oracle-like unpredictability property

   Pseudorandomness, as defined in Section 3.3, does not hold if the VRF
   keys were generated adversarially.  For instance, if an adversary
   outputs VRF keys that are deterministically generated (or hard-coded
   and publicly known), then the outputs are easily derived by anyone.

   There is, however, a different type of unpredictability that is
   desirable in certain VRF applications (such as [GHMVZ17] and
   [KRDO17]).  This property is similar to the unpredictability achieved
   by an (ordinary, unkeyed) cryptographic hash function: if the input
   has enough entropy (i.e., cannot be predicted), then the correct
   output is indistinguishable from uniform.

   Although neither formal definitions nor proofs of this property have
   appeared in cryptographic literature, the VRF schemes presented in



Goldberg, et al.        Expires February 9, 2020                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                     VRF                       August 2019


   this specification are believed to satisfy this property if the
   public key was generated in a trustworthy manner.  Additionally, the
   ECVRF also satisifies this property even if the public key was not
   generated in a trustworthy manner, as long as the public key
   satisfies the key validation procedure in Section 5.6.

4.  RSA Full Domain Hash VRF (RSA-FDH-VRF)

   The RSA Full Domain Hash VRF (RSA-FDH-VRF) is a VRF that satisfies
   the "trusted uniqueness", "trusted collision resistance", and "full
   pseudorandomness" properties defined in Section 3.  Its security
   follows from the standard RSA assumption in the random oracle model.
   Formal security proofs are in [PWHVNRG17].

   The VRF computes the proof pi as a deterministic RSA signature on
   input alpha using the RSA Full Domain Hash Algorithm [RFC8017]
   parametrized with the selected hash algorithm.  RSA signature
   verification is used to verify the correctness of the proof.  The VRF
   hash output beta is simply obtained by hashing the proof pi with the
   selected hash algorithm.

   The key pair for RSA-FDH-VRF MUST be generated in a way that it
   satisfies the conditions specified in Section 3 of [RFC8017].

   In this document, the notation from [RFC8017] is used.

   Parameters used:

      (n, e) - RSA public key

      K - RSA private key

      k - length in octets of the RSA modulus n (k must be less than
      2^32)

   The Elliptic Curve Verifiable Random Function (ECVRF) is a VRF that
   satisfies the trusted uniqueness, trusted collision resistance, and

   of this VRF follows from the decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH)
   assumption in the random oracle model.  Formal security proofs are in
   [PWHVNRG17].

   To additionally satisfy "full uniqueness" and "full collision
   resistance", the Verifier MUST additionally perform the validation
   procedure specified in Section 5.6 upon receipt of the public VRF
   key.

   Fixed options (specified in Section 5.5):

      F - finite field

      2n - length, in octets, of a field element in F, rounded up to the
      nearest even integer

      E - elliptic curve (EC) defined over F

      ptLen - length, in octets, of an EC point encoded as an octet
      string

      G - subgroup of E of large prime order

      q - prime order of group G

      qLen - length of q in octets, i.e., smallest integer such that
      2^(8qLen)>q (note that in the typical case, qLen equals 2n or is
      close to 2n)

      cofactor - number of points on E divided by q

      B - generator of group G

      Hash - cryptographic hash function

      hLen - output length in octets of Hash; must be at least 2n

   Notation and primitives used:

      Elliptic curve operations are written in additive notation, with
      P+Q denoting point addition and x*P denoting scalar multiplication
      of a point P by a scalar x

      x^y - a raised to the power b

      x*y - a multiplied by b

      || - octet string concatenation

      ECVRF_hash_to_curve - collision resistant hash of strings to an EC
      point; options described in Section 5.4.1 and specified in
      Section 5.5.

      ECVRF_nonce_generation - derives a pseudorandom nonce from SK and
      the input as part of ECVRF proving.  Specified in Section 5.5

      ECVRF_hash_points - collision resistant hash of EC points to an
      integer.  Specified in Section 5.4.3.

   Type conversions:

      int_to_string(a, len) - conversion of nonnegative integer a to to
      octet string of length len as specified in Section 5.5.

      string_to_int(a_string) - conversion of an octet string a_string
      to a nonnegative integer as specified in Section 5.5.

      point_to_string - conversion of EC point to an ptLen-octet string
      as specified in Section 5.5

      string_to_point - conversion of an ptLen-octet string to EC point
      as specified in Section 5.5.  string_to_point returns INVALID if
      the octet string does not convert to a valid EC point.

      arbitrary_string_to_point - conversion of an arbitrary octet
      string to an EC point as specified in Section 5.5

      Note that with certain software libraries (for big integer and
      elliptic curve arithmetic), the int_to_string and point_to_string
      conversions are not needed.  For example, in some implementations,
      EC point operations will take octet strings as inputs and produce
      octet strings as outputs, without introducing a separate elliptic
      curve point type.

   Parameters used (the generation of these parameters is specified in
   Section 5.5):

      SK - VRF private key

      x - VRF secret scalar, an integer

         Note: depending on the ciphersuite used, the VRF secret scalar
         may be equal to SK; else, it is derived from SK

      Y = x*B - VRF public key, an EC point

5.1.  ECVRF Proving

   ECVRF_prove(SK, alpha_string)

   Input:

      SK - VRF private key

      alpha_string = input alpha, an octet string

   Output:

      pi_string - VRF proof, octet string of length ptLen+n+qLen

   Steps:

   1.  Use SK to derive the VRF secret scalar x and the VRF public key Y
       = x*B
       (this derivation depends on the ciphersuite, as per Section 5.5;
       these values can be cached, for example, after key generation,
       and need not be rederived each time)

   2.  H = ECVRF_hash_to_curve(suite_string, Y, alpha_string)

   3.  h_string = point_to_string(H)

   4.  Gamma = x*H

   5.  k = ECVRF_nonce_generation(SK, h_string)

   6.  c = ECVRF_hash_points(H, Gamma, k*B, k*H)

   7.  s = (k + c*x) mod q

   8.  pi_string = point_to_string(Gamma) || int_to_string(c, n) ||
       int_to_string(s, qLen)

   Output:

      "INVALID", or

   Important note:

      ECVRF_proof_to_hash should be run only on pi_string that is known
      to have been produced by ECVRF_prove, or from within ECVRF_verify
      as specified in Section 5.3.

   Steps:

   1.  D = ECVRF_decode_proof(pi_string)

   2.  If D is "INVALID", output "INVALID" and stop

   3.  (Gamma, c, s) = D

   4.  three_string = 0x03 = int_to_string(3, 1), a single octet with
       value 3

   5.  beta_string = Hash(suite_string || three_string ||
       point_to_string(cofactor * Gamma))

   6.  Output beta_string

5.3.  ECVRF Verifying

   ECVRF_verify(Y, pi_string, alpha_string)

      alpha_string - VRF input, octet string

   Output:

      ("VALID", beta_string), where beta_string is the VRF hash output,
      octet string of length hLen; or
      "INVALID"

   Steps:

   1.  D = ECVRF_decode_proof(pi_string)

   2.  If D is "INVALID", output "INVALID" and stop

   3.  (Gamma, c, s) = D

   4.  H = ECVRF_hash_to_curve(suite_string, Y, alpha_string)

   5.  U = s*B - c*Y

   6.  V = s*H - c*Gamma

   7.  c' = ECVRF_hash_points(H, Gamma, U, V)

   8.  If c and c' are equal, output ("VALID",
       ECVRF_proof_to_hash(pi_string)); else output "INVALID"

5.4.  ECVRF Auxiliary Functions

5.4.1.  ECVRF Hash To Curve

   The ECVRF_hash_to_curve algorithm takes in the VRF input alpha and
   converts it to H, an EC point in G.  This algorithm is the only place
   the VRF input alpha is used in for proving and verfying.  See
   Section 7.6 for further discussion.

   The algorithms in this section are not compatible with each other;
   the choice of algorithm is made in Section 5.5.

5.4.1.1.  ECVRF_hash_to_curve_try_and_increment

   The following ECVRF_hash_to_curve_try_and_increment(suite_string, Y,
   alpha_string) algorithm implements ECVRF_hash_to_curve in a simple
   and generic way that works for any elliptic curve.

   The running time of this algorithm depends on alpha_string.  For the
   ciphersuites specified in Section 5.5, this algorithm is expected to

   find a valid curve point after approximately two attempts (i.e., when
   ctr=1) on average.

   However, because the running time of algorithm depends on
   alpha_string, this algorithm SHOULD be avoided in applications where
   it is important that the VRF input alpha remain secret.

   ECVRF_hash_to_try_and_increment(suite_string, Y, alpha_string)

   Input:

      suite_string - a single octet specifying ECVRF ciphersuite.

      Y - public key, an EC point

      alpha_string - value to be hashed, an octet string

   Output:

      H - hashed value, a finite EC point in G

   Steps:

   1.  ctr = 0

   2.  PK_string = point_to_string(Y)

   3.  one_string = 0x01 = int_to_string(1, 1), a single octet with
       value 1

   4.  H = "INVALID"

   5.  While H is "INVALID" or H is EC point at infinity:

       A.  ctr_string = int_to_string(ctr, 1)

       B.  hash_string = Hash(suite_string || one_string || PK_string ||
           alpha_string || ctr_string)

       C.  H = arbitrary_string_to_point(hash_string)

       D.  If H is not "INVALID" and cofactor > 1, set H = cofactor * H

       E.  ctr = ctr + 1

   6.  Output H

5.4.1.2.  ECVRF_hash_to_curve_elligator2_25519

   The following ECVRF_hash_to_curve_elligator2_25519(suite_string, Y,
   alpha_string) algorithm implements ECVRF_hash_to_curve using the
   elligator2 algorithm from Section 5 of [BHKT13] (see also
   [I-D.irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve]) exclusively for the edwards25519
   elliptic curve.  It can be implemented with running time that is
   independent of the input alpha (so-called "constant-time").

   ECVRF_hash_to_curve_elligator2_25519(suite_string, Y, alpha_string)

   Input:

      suite_string - a single octet specifying ECVRF ciphersuite.

      alpha_string - value to be hashed, an octet string

      Y - public key, an EC point

   Output:

      H - hashed value, a finite EC point in G

   Fixed options:

      p = 2^255-19, the size of the finite field F, a prime, for
      edwards25519 and curve25519 curves

      A = 486662, Montgomery curve constant for curve25519

      cofactor = 8, the cofactor for edwards25519 and curve25519 curves

   Constraints on options:

      output length of Hash is at least 16n (i.e., 256) bits

   Steps:

   1.   PK_string = point_to_string(Y)

   2.   one_string = 0x01 = int_to_string(1, 1)
        (a single octet with value 1)

   3.   hash_string = Hash(suite_string || one_string || PK_string ||
        alpha_string )

   4.   truncated_h_string = hash_string[0]...hash_string[31]

   5.   oneTwentySeven_string = 0x7F = int_to_string(127, 1)
        (a single octet with value 127)

   6.   truncated_h_string[31] = truncated_h_string[31] &
        oneTwentySeven_string
        (this step clears the high-order bit of octet 31)

   7.   r = string_to_int(truncated_h_string)

   8.   u = - A / (1 + 2*(r^2) ) mod p
        (note: the inverse of (1+2*(r^2)) modulo p is guaranteed to
        exist)

   9.   w = u * (u^2 + A*u + 1) mod p
        (this step evaluates the Montgomery equation for Curve25519)

   10.  Let e equal the Legendre symbol of w and p
        (see note below on how to compute e)

   11.  If e is equal to 1 then final_u = u; else final_u = (-A - u) mod
        p
        (note: final_u is the Montgomery u-coordinate of the output; see
        note below on how to compute it)

   12.  y_coordinate = (final_u - 1) / (final_u + 1) mod p
        (note 1: y_coordinate is the Edwards coordinate corresponding to
        final_u)
        (note 2: the inverse of (final_u + 1) modulo p is guaranteed to
        exist)

   13.  h_string = int_to_string (y_coordinate, 32)

   14.  H_prelim = string_to_point(h_string)
        (note: string_to_point will not return INVALID by correctness of
        Elligator2)

   15.  Set H = cofactor * H_prelim

   16.  Output H

   In order to make this algorithm run in time that is (almost)
   independent of the input alpha_string (so-called "constant-time"),
   implementers should pay particular attention to Steps 10 and 11
   above.  These steps can be implemented using the following approach:

      e = w ^ ((p-1)/2) mod p

      final_u = (e*u + (e-1) * (A/2)) mod p



Goldberg, et al.        Expires February 9, 2020               [Page 17]

Internet-Draft                     VRF                       August 2019


   The first step will produce a value e that is either 1 or p-1 (it is
   guaranteed not to be any other value, because w is guaranteed to be
   nonzero).  Implementers should also ensure that the second step runs
   in the same amount of time regardless of e by ensuring that
   arithmetic in constant time.

   Alternatively, let CMOV(result_if_1, result_if_0, selector) be the
   function that returns result_if_1 when selector is 1 and result_if_0
   when selector is 0.  If CMOV is implemented in constant time, then
   steps 12 and 13 above can be implemented as follows:

      e = (w^((p-1)/2))+1 mod p

      b = e/2

      other_u = (-A-u) mod p

      final_u = CMOV(u, other_u, b)

   (Note that after the first step, e is either 0 or 2, and only the
   least significant byte of e is needed in the second step).  CMOV can
   be implemented in constant time a variety of ways; for example, by
   expanding b from a single bit to an all-0 or all-1 string
   (accomplished by negating b in standard two's-complement arithmetic)
   and then applying bitwise XOR and AND operations as follows: other_x
   XOR ((x XOR other_x) AND b)

   If having this algorithm run in constant time is not important, then
   there are much faster algorithms to compute the Legendre symbol
   (which is the same as the Jacobi symbol because p is a prime).  See,
   for example, Section 12.3 of [ntb].

5.4.1.3.  ECVRF_hash_to_curve_Simplified_SWU

   The following ECVRF_hash_to_curve_Simplified_SWU(suite_string, Y,
   alpha_string) algorithm implements ECVRF_hash_to_curve using the
   simplified Shallue-Woestijne [SW06] and Ulas [Ulas07] algorithm from
   Section 7 of [BCIMRT10] (see also [I-D.irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve]).  It
   can be implemented with running time that is independent of the input
   alpha (so-called "constant-time").  Generally, this method can be
   used for any curve with prime p that is congruent to 3 modulo 4;
   however, the (very unlikely) case of d=0 in step 6 below may need to
   be handled differently depending on the curve equation, to ensure
   that the result is a point on the curve.

   7.   If d = 0 then d_inverse = 0; else d_inverse = 1/d mod p
        (as long as Hash is secure, the case of d = 0 is an utterly

   If arithmetic and CMOV are implemented in constant time, then steps 9
   and 10 above can be implemented as follows:

      e = (w ^ ((p-1)/2))+1 mod p
      (At this point, e is 0, 1, or 2, as an integer.)

      Let b = (e+1) / 2, where / denotes integer division with rounding
      down.
      (Note carefully that this step is integer, not modular, division.
      Only the last byte of e is needed for this step.  This step
      converts 0, 1, or 2 to 0 or 1.)

      other_x = r * x mod p

      final_x = CMOV(x, other_x, b)

   CMOV can be implemented in constant time a variety of ways; for
   example, by expanding b from a single bit to an all-0 or all-1 string

      parameters as specified in [FIPS-186-4] (Section D.1.2.3) and

5.6.  When the ECVRF Keys are Untrusted

   The ECVRF as specified above is a VRF that satisfies the "trusted
   uniqueness", "trusted collision resistance", and "full
   pseudorandomness" properties defined in Section 3.  In order to
   obtain "full uniqueness" and "full collision resistance" (which
   provide protection against a malicious VRF public key), the Verifier
   MUST perform the following additional validation procedure upon
   receipt of the public VRF key.  The public VRF key MUST NOT be used
   if this procedure returns "INVALID".

   Note that this procedure is not sufficient if the elliptic curve E or
   the point B, the generator of group G, is untrusted.  If the prover
   is untrusted, the Verifier MUST obtain E and B from a trusted source,
   such as a ciphersuite specification, rather than from the prover.

   This procedure supposes that the public key provided to the Verifier
   is an octet string.  The procedure returns "INVALID" if the public
   key in invalid.  Otherwise, it returns Y, the public key as an EC
   point.

5.6.1.  ECVRF Validate Key

   ECVRF_validate_key(PK_string)

   Input:

      PK_string - public key, an octet string

   Output:

      "INVALID", or

      Y - public key, an EC point

   Steps:

   1.  Y = string_to_point(PK_string)

   2.  If Y is "INVALID", output "INVALID" and stop

   3.  If cofactor*Y is the EC point at infinty, output "INVALID" and
       stop

   4.  Output Y

   Note that if the cofactor = 1, then Step 3 need not multiply Y by the
   cofactor; instead, it suffices to output "INVALID" if Y is the point

   at infinity.  Moreover, when cofactor>1, it is not necessary to
   verify that Y is in the subgroup G; Step 3 suffices.  Therefore, if
   the cofactor is small, the total number of points that could cause
   Step 3 to output "INVALID" may be small, and it may be more efficient
   to simply check Y against a fixed list of such points.  For example,
   the following algorithm can be used for the edwards25519 curve:

   1.   Y = string_to_point(PK_string)

   2.   If Y is "INVALID", output "INVALID" and stop

   3.   y_string = PK_string

   4.   oneTwentySeven_string = 0x7F = int_to_string(127, 1)
        (a single octet with value 127)

   5.   y_string[31] = y_string[31] & oneTwentySeven_string
        (this step clears the high-order bit of octet 31)

   6.   bad_pk[0] = int_to_string(0, 32)

   7.   bad_pk[1] = int_to_string(1, 32)

   8.   bad_y2 = 2707385501144840649318225287225658788936804267575313519
        463743609750303402022

   9.   bad_pk[2] = int_to_string(bad_y2, 32)

   10.  bad_pk[3] = int_to_string(p-bad_y2, 32)

   11.  bad_pk[4] = int_to_string(p-1, 32)

   12.  bad_pk[5] = int_to_string(p, 32)

   13.  bad_pk[6] = int_to_string(p+1, 32)

   14.  If y_string is in bad_pk[0]...bad_pk[6], output "INVALID" and
        stop

   15.  Output Y

   (bad_pk[0], bad_pk[2], bad_pk[3] each match two bad public keys,
   depending on the sign of the x-coordinate, which was cleared in step
   5, in order to make sure that it does not affect the comparison.
   bad_pk[1] and bad_pk[4] each match one bad public key, because
   x-coordinate is 0 for these two public keys. bad_pk[5] and bad_pk[6]
   are simply bad_pk[0] and bad_pk[1] shifted by p, in case the
   y-coordinate had not been modular reduced by p.  There is no need to

   These bad keys, which represent all points of order 1, 2, 4, and 8,
   have been obtained by converting the points specified in [X25519] to

   An implementation of an earlier, slightly different, version of RSA-
   FDH-VRF (SHA-256) and ECVRF-P256-SHA256-TAI was first developed as a
   part of the NSEC5 project [I-D.vcelak-nsec5] and is available at

   The Key Transparency project at Google uses a VRF implemention that
   is similar to the ECVRF-P256-SHA256-TAI, with a few minor changes
   including the use of SHA-512 instead of SHA-256.  Its implementation
   is available at
   <https://github.com/google/keytransparency/blob/master/core/vrf/
   vrf.go>

   An implementation by Yahoo! similar to the ECVRF is available at

   An implementation similar to ECVRF is available as part of the CONIKS
   implementation in Golang at <https://github.com/coniks-sys/coniks-
   go/tree/master/crypto/vrf>.

   Open Whisper Systems also uses a VRF very similar to ECVRF-

7.  Security Considerations

7.1.  Key Generation

   Applications that use the VRFs defined in this document MUST ensure
   that that the VRF key is generated correctly, using good randomness.

7.1.1.  Uniqueness and collision resistance with untrusted keys

   The ECVRF as specified in Section 5.1-Section 5.5 statisfies the
   "trusted uniqueness" and "trusted collision resistance" properties as
   long as the VRF keys are generated correctly, with good randomness.
   If the Verifier trusts the VRF keys are generated correctly, it MAY
   use the public key Y as is.

   However, if the ECVRF uses keys that could be generated
   adversarially, then the the Verfier MUST first perform the validation
   procedure ECVRF_validate_key(PK) (specified in Section 5.6) upon
   receipt of the public key PK as an octet string.  If the validation
   procedure outputs "INVALID", then the public key MUST not be used.
   Otherwise, the procedure will output a valid public key Y, and the
   ECVRF with public key Y satisfies the "full uniqueness" and "full
   collision resistance" properties.

   The RSA-FDH-VRF statisfies the "trusted uniqueness" and "trusted
   collision resistance" properties as long as the VRF keys are
   generated correctly, with good randomness.  These properties may not
   hold if the keys are generated adversarially (e.g., if RSA is not
   permutation).  Meanwhile, the "full uniqueness" and "full collision
   resistance" are properties that hold even if VRF keys are generated
   by an adversary.  The RSA-FDH-VRF defined in this document does not
   have these properties.  However, if adversarial key generation is a
   concern, the RSA-FDH-VRF may be modifed to have these properties by
   adding additional cryptographic checks that its public key has the
   right form.  These modifications are left for future specification.

7.1.2.  Pseudorandomness with untrusted keys

   Without good randomness, the "pseudorandomness" properties of the VRF
   may not hold.  Note that it is not possible to guarantee
   pseudorandomness in the face of adversarially generated VRF keys.
   This is because an adversary can always use bad randomness to
   generate the VRF keys, and thus, the VRF output may not be
   pseudorandom.

Internet-Draft                     VRF                       August 2019


7.2.  Selective vs Full Pseudorandomness

   [PWHVNRG17] presents cryptographic reductions to an underlying hard
   problem (e.g.  Decisional Diffie Hellman for the ECVRF, or the
   standard RSA assumption for RSA-FDH-VRF) that prove the VRFs
   specificied in this document possess full pseudorandomness as well as
   selective pseudorandomness.  However, the cryptographic reductions
   are tighter for selective pseudorandomness than for full
   pseudorandomness.  This means the the VRFs have quantitavely stronger
   security guarentees for selective pseudorandomness.

   Applications that are concerned about tightness of cryptographic
   reductions therefore have two options.

   o  They may choose to ensure that selective pseudorandomness is
      sufficient for the application.  That is, that pseudorandomness of
      outputs matters only for inputs that are chosen independently of
      the VRF key.

   o  If full pseudorandomness is required for the application, the
      application may increase security parameters to make up for the
      loose security reduction.  For RSA-FDH-VRF, this means increasing
      the RSA key length.  For ECVRF, this means increasing the
      cryptographic strength of the EC group G.  For both RSA-FDH-VRF
      and ECVRF the cryptographic strength of the hash function Hash may
      also potentially need to be increased.

7.3.  Proper pseudorandom nonce for ECVRF

   The security of the ECVRF defined in this document relies on the fact
   that nonce k used in the ECVRF_prove algorithm is chosen uniformly
   and pseudorandomly modulo q, and is unknown to the advesrary.
   Otherwise, an adversary may be able to recover the private VRF key x
   (and thus break pseudorandomness of the VRF) after observing several
   valid VRF proofs pi.  The nonce generation methods specified in the
   ECVRF ciphersuites of Section 5.5 are designed with this requirement
   in mind.

7.4.  Side-channel attacks

   Side channel attacks on cryptographic primatives are an important
   issue.  Here we discuss only one such side channel: timing attacks
   that can be used to leak information about the VRF input alpha.
   Implementers should take care to avoid side-channel attacks that leak
   information about the VRF private key SK (and the nonce k used in the
   ECVRF).

Internet-Draft                     VRF                       August 2019


   The ECVRF_hash_to_curve_try_and_increment algorithm defined in
   Section 5.4.1.1 SHOULD NOT be used in applications where the VRF
   input alpha is secret and is hashed by the VRF on-the-fly.  This is
   because the algorithm's running time depends on the VRF input alpha,
   and thus creates a timing channel that can be used to learn
   information about alpha.  That said, for most inputs the amount of
   information obtained from such a timing attack is likely to be small
   (1 bit, on average), since the algorithm is expected to find a valid
   curve point after only two attempts.  However, there might be inputs
   which cause the algorithm to make many attempts before it finds a
   valid curve point; for such inputs, the information leaked in a
   timing attack will be more than 1 bit.

   Meanwhile, ECVRF-P256-SHA256-SWU and ECVRF-
   EDWARDS25519-SHA512-Elligator2 can be made to run in time constant in
   alpha.

7.5.  Proofs Provide No Secrecy for VRF Input

   The VRF proof pi is not designed to provide secrecy and, in general,
   may reveal the VRF input alpha.  Anyone who knows PK and pi is able
   to perform an offline dictionary attack to search for alpha, by
   verifying guesses for alpha using VRF_verify.  This is in contrast to
   the VRF hash output beta which, without the proof, is pseudorandom
   and thus is designed to reveal no information about alpha.

7.6.  Prehashing

   The VRFs specified in this document allow for read-once access to the
   input alpha for both signing and verifying.  Thus, additional
   prehashing of alpha (as specified, for example, in [RFC8032] for
   EdDSA signatures) is not needed, even for applications that need to
   handle long alpha or to support the Initialized-Update-Finalize (IUF)
   interface (in such an interface, alpha is not supplied all at once,
   but rather in pieces by a sequence of calls to Update).  The ECVRF,
   in particular, uses alpha only in ECVRF_hash_to_curve.  The curve
   point H becomes the representative of alpha thereafter.  Note that
   the suite_string octet and the public key are hashed together with
   alpha in ECVRF_hash_to_curve, which ensures that the curve (including
   the generator B) and the public key are included indirectly into
   subsequent hashes.

7.7.  Hash function domain separation and future-proofing

   Hashing is used for different purposes in the two VRFs (namely, in
   the RSA-FDH-VRF, in MGF1 and in proof_to_hash; in the ECVRF, in
   hash_to_curve, nonce_generation, hash_points, and proof_to_hash).
   The theoretical analysis assumes each of these functions is a



Goldberg, et al.        Expires February 9, 2020               [Page 31]

   separate random oracle.  This analysis still holds even if the same
   hash function is used, as long as the four queries made to the hash
   function for a given SK and alpha are overwhelmingly unlikely to
   equal each other or to any queries made to the hash function for the
   same SK and different alpha.  This is indeed the case for the RSA-
   FDH-VRF defined in this document, because the first octets of the
   input to the hash function used in MGF1 and in proof_to_hash are
   different.  This is also the case for the ECVRF ciphersuites defined
   in this document, because:

   o  inputs to the hash function used during nonce_generation are
      unlikely to equal to inputs given to hash_to_curve, proof_to_hash,
      and hash_points.  This follows since nonce_generation inputs a
      secret to the hash function that is not used by honest parties as
      input to any other hash function, and is not available to the
      adversary

   o  the second octet of the input to the hash function used in
      hash_to_curve, proof_to_hash, and hash_points are all different

   For the RSA VRF, if future designs need to specify variants of the
   design in this document, such variants should use different first
   octets in inputs to MGF1 and to the hash funciton used in
   proof_to_hash, in order to avoid the possibility that an adversary
   can obtain a VRF output under one variant, and then claim it was
   obtained under another variant

   For the elliptic curve VRF, if future designs need to specify
   variants (e.g., additional ciphersuites) of the design in this
   document, then, to avoid the possibility that an adversary can obtain
   a VRF output under one variant, and then claim it was obtained under
   another variant, they should specify a different suite_string
   constant.  This way, the inputs to the hash_to_curve hash function
   used in producing H are guaranteed to be different; since all the
   other hashing done by the prover depends on H, inputs all the hash
   functions used by the prover will also be different as long as
   hash_to_curve is collision resistant.

      made because Ed25519 in [RFC8032] signatures use SHA512 and not
      SHA256.)  Made ECVRF nonce generation a separate component, so
      that nonces are determinsitic.  In ECVRF proving, changed + to -
      (and made corresponding verification changes) in order to be
      consistent with EdDSA and ECDSA.  Highlighted that
      ECVRF_hash_to_curve acts like a prehash.  Added "suites" variable
      to ECVRF for future-proofing.  Ensured domain separation for hash
      functions by modifying hash_points and added discussion about
      domain separation.  Updated todos in the "additional
      pseudorandomness property" section.  Added an discussion of
      secrecy into security considerations.  Removed B and PK=Y from
      ECVRF_hash_points because they are already present via H, which is
      computed via hash_to_curve using the suite_string (which
      identifies B) and Y.

      03 - Changed Ed25519 conversions to little-endian, to match RFC
      8032; added simple key validation for Ed25519; added Simple SWU
      cipher suite; clarified Elligator and removed the extra x0 bit, to
      make Montgomery and Edwards Elligator the same; added domain
      separation for RSA VRF; improved notation throughout; added nonce
      generation as a section; changed counter in try-and-increment from
      four bytes to one, to avoid endian issues; renamed try-and-
      increment ciphersuites to -TAI; added qLen as a separate
      paremeter; changed output length to hLen for ECVRF, to match
      RSAVRF; made Verify return beta so unverified proofs don't end up
      in proof_to_hash; added test vectors.

      04 - Clarified handling of optional arguments x and PK in
      ECVRF_prove.  Edited implementation status to bring it up to date.

      05 - Renamed ed25519 into the more commonly used edwards25519.
      Corrected ECVRF_nonce_generation_RFC6979 (thanks to Gorka Irazoqui
      Apecechea and Mario Cao Cueto for finding the problem) and
      corresponding test vectors for the P256 suites.  Added a reference
      to the Rust implementation.
