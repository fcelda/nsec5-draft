            NSEC5, DNSSEC Authenticated Denial of Existence
                         draft-vcelak-nsec5-05

Abstract

   The Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) introduced the
   NSEC resource record (RR) for authenticated denial of existence and
   the NSEC3 RR for hashed authenticated denial of existence.  This
   document introduces NSEC5 as an alternative mechanism for DNSSEC
   authenticated denial of existence.  NSEC5 uses verifiable random
   functions (VRFs) to prevent offline enumeration of zone contents.
   NSEC5 also protects the integrity of the zone contents even if an
   adversary compromises one of the authoritative servers for the zone.
   Integrity is preserved because NSEC5 does not require private zone-
   signing keys to be present on all authoritative servers for the zone,
   in contrast to DNSSEC online signing schemes like NSEC3 White Lies.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Rationale

   NSEC5 provides an alternative mechanism for authenticated denial of
   existence for the DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC).  NSEC5 has two
   key security properties.  First, NSEC5 protects the integrity of the



Vcelak, et al.         Expires September 10, 2017               [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                    NSEC5                       March 2017


   zone contents even if an adversary compromises one of the
   authoritative servers for the zone.  Second, NSEC5 prevents offline
   zone enumeration, where an adversary makes a small number of online
   DNS queries and then processes them offline in order to learn all of
   the names in a zone.  Zone enumeration can be used to identify
   routers, servers or other "things" that could then be targeted in
   more complex attacks.  An enumerated zone can also be a source of
   probable email addresses for spam, or as a "key for multiple WHOIS
   queries to reveal registrant data that many registries may have legal
   obligations to protect" [RFC5155].

   All other DNSSEC mechanisms for authenticated denial of existence
   either fail to preserve integrity against a compromised server, or
   fail to prevent offline zone enumeration.

   When offline signing with NSEC is used [RFC4034], an NSEC chain of
   all existing domain names in the zone is constructed and signed
   offline.  The chain is made of resource records (RRs), where each RR
   represents two consecutive domain names in canonical order present in
   the zone.  The authoritative server proves the non-existence of a
   name by presenting a signed NSEC RR which covers the name.  Because
   the authoritative server does not need not to know the private zone-
   signing key, the integrity of the zone is protected even if the
   server is compromised.  However, the NSEC chain allows for easy zone
   enumeration: N queries to the server suffice to learn all N names in
   the zone (see e.g., [nmap-nsec-enum], [nsec3map], and [ldns-walk]).

   When offline signing with NSEC3 is used [RFC5155], the original names
   in the NSEC chain are replaced by their cryptographic hashes.
   Offline signing ensures that NSEC3 preserves integrity even if an
   authoritative server is compromised.  However, offline zone
   enumeration is still possible with NSEC3 (see e.g., [nsec3walker],
   [nsec3gpu]), and is part of standard network reconnaissance tools
   (e.g., [nmap-nsec3-enum], [nsec3map]).

   When online signing is used, the authoritative server holds the
   private zone-signing key and uses this key to synthesize NSEC or
   NSEC3 responses on the fly (e.g.  NSEC3 White Lies (NSEC3-WL) or
   Minimally-Covering NSEC, both described in [RFC7129]).  Because the
   synthesized response only contains information about the queried name
   (but not about any other name in the zone), offline zone enumeration
   is not possible.  However, because the authoritative server holds the
   private zone-signing key, integrity is lost if the authoritative
   server is compromised.

   +----------+-------------+---------------+----------------+---------+

   NSEC5 prevents offline zone enumeration and also protects integrity
   even if a zone's authoritative server is compromised.  To do this,
   NSEC5 replaces the unkeyed cryptographic hash function used in NSEC3
   with a verifiable random function (VRF) [MRV99].  A VRF is the
   public-key version of a keyed cryptographic hash.  Only the holder of
   the private VRF key can compute the hash, but anyone with public VRF
   key can verify the correctness of the hash.

   The public VRF key is distributed in an NSEC5KEY RR, similar to a
   DNSKEY RR, and is used to verify NSEC5 hash values.  The private VRF
   key is present on all authoritative servers for the zone, and is used
   to compute hash values.  For every query that elicits a negative
   response, the authoritative server hashes the query on the fly using
   the private VRF key, and also returns the corresponding precomputed
   NSEC5 record(s).  In contrast to the online signing approach
   [RFC7129], the private key that is present on all authoritative
   servers for NSEC5 cannot be used to modify the zone contents.

   Like online signing approaches, NSEC5 requires the authoritative
   server to perform online public key cryptographic operations for
   every query eliciting a denying response.  This is necessary; [nsec5]
   proved that online cryptography is required to prevent offline zone
   enumeration while still protecting the integrity of zone contents
   against network attacks.

   NSEC5 is not intended to replace NSEC or NSEC3.  It is an alternative
   mechanism for authenticated denial of existence.  This document
   specifies NSEC5 based on the FIPS 186-3 P-256 elliptic curve and on
   the Ed25519 elliptic curve.  A formal cryptographic proof of security
   for elliptic curve (EC) NSEC5 is in [nsec5ecc].

1.2.  Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.3.  Terminology

   The reader is assumed to be familiar with the basic DNS and DNSSEC
   concepts described in [RFC1034], [RFC1035], [RFC4033], [RFC4034], and
   [RFC4035]; subsequent RFCs that update them in [RFC2136], [RFC2181],
   [RFC2308], [RFC5155], and [RFC7129]; and DNS terms in [RFC7719].

   The reader should also be familiar with verifiable random functions
   (VRFs) as defined in [ID.goldbe-vrf].

   The following terminology is used through this document:

   Base32hex:  The "Base 32 Encoding with Extended Hex Alphabet" as
      specified in [RFC4648].  The padding characters ("=") are not used
      in the NSEC5 specification.

   Base64:  The "Base 64 Encoding" as specified in [RFC4648].

   QNAME:  The domain name being queried (query name).

   Private NSEC5 key:  The private key for the verifiable random
      function (VRF).

   Public NSEC5 key:  The public key for the VRF.

   NSEC5 proof:  A VRF proof.  The holder of the private NSEC5 key
      (e.g., authoritative server) can compute the NSEC5 proof for an
      input domain name.  Anyone who knows the public VRF key can verify
      that the NSEC5 proof corresponds to the input domain name.

   NSEC5 hash:  A cryptographic digest of an NSEC5 proof.  If the NSEC5
      proof is known, anyone can compute its corresponding NSEC5 hash.

   NSEC5 algorithm:  A triple of VRF algorithms that compute an NSEC5
      proof (VRF_prove), verify an NSEC5 proof (VRF_verify), and process
      an NSEC5 proof to obtain its NSEC5 hash (VRF_proof2hash).

2.  Backward Compatibility

   The specification describes a protocol change that is not backward
   compatible with [RFC4035] and [RFC5155].  An NSEC5-unaware resolver
   will fail to validate responses introduced by this document.

   To prevent NSEC5-unaware resolvers from attempting to validate the
   responses, new DNSSEC algorithms identifiers are introduced in
   Section 16 which alias existing algorithm numbers.  The zones signed
   according to this specification MUST use only these algorithm

   identifiers, thus NSEC5-unaware resolvers will treat the zone as
   insecure.

3.  How NSEC5 Works

   With NSEC5, the original domain name is hashed using a VRF
   [ID.goldbe-vrf] using the following steps:

   1.  The domain name is processed using a VRF keyed with the private
       NSEC5 key to obtain the NSEC5 proof.  Anyone who knows the public
       NSEC5 key, normally acquired via an NSEC5KEY RR, can verify that
       a given NSEC5 proof corresponds to a given domain name.

   2.  The NSEC5 proof is then processed using a publicly-computable VRF
       proof-to-hash function to obtain the NSEC5 hash.  The NSEC5 hash
       can be computed by anyone who knows the input NSEC5 proof.

   The NSEC5 hash determines the position of a domain name in an NSEC5
   chain.

   To sign a zone, the private NSEC5 key is used to compute the NSEC5
   hashes for each name in the zone.  These NSEC5 hashes are sorted in
   canonical order [RFC4034], and each consecutive pair forms an NSEC5
   RR.  Each NSEC5 RR is signed offline using the private zone-signing
   key.  The resulting signed chain of NSEC5 RRs is provided to all
   authoritative servers for the zone, along with the private NSEC5 key.

   To prove non-existence of a particular domain name in response to a
   query, the server uses the private NSEC5 key to compute the NSEC5
   proof and NSEC5 hash corresponding to the queried name.  The server
   then identifies the NSEC5 RR that covers the NSEC5 hash, and responds
   with this NSEC5 RR and its corresponding RRSIG signature RRset, as
   well as a synthesized NSEC5PROOF RR that contains the NSEC5 proof
   corresponding to the queried name.

   To validate the response, the client verifies the following items:

   o  The client uses the public NSEC5 key, normally acquired from the
      NSEC5KEY RR, to verify that the NSEC5 proof in the NSEC5PROOF RR
      corresponds to the queried name.

   o  The client uses the VRF proof-to-hash function to compute the
      NSEC5 hash from the NSEC5 proof in the NSEC5PROOF RR.  The client
      verifies that the NSEC5 hash is covered by the NSEC5 RR.

   o  The client verifies that the NSEC5 RR is validly signed by the
      RRSIG RRset.

4.  NSEC5 Algorithms

   The algorithms used for NSEC5 authenticated denial are independent of
   the algorithms used for DNSSEC signing.  An NSEC5 algorithm defines
   how the NSEC5 proof and the NSEC5 hash are computed and validated.

   The NSEC5 proof corresponding to a name is computed using
   VRF_prove(), as specified in [ID.goldbe-vrf].  The input to
   VRF_prove() is a private NSEC5 key followed by an RR owner name in
   [RFC4034] canonical wire format.  The output NSEC5 proof is an octet
   string.

   An NSEC5 hash corresponding to a name is computed from its NSEC5
   proof using VRF_proof2hash(), as specified in [ID.goldbe-vrf].  The
   input to VRF_proof2hash() is an NSEC5 proof as an octet string; the
   output NSEC5 hash is an octet string.

   An NSEC5 proof for a name is verified using VRF_verify(), as
   specified in [ID.goldbe-vrf].  The input is the NSEC5 public key,
   followed by an RR owner name in [RFC4034] canonical wire format,
   followed by an NSEC5 proof as an octet string; the output is either
   VALID or INVALID.

   This document defines the EC-P256-SHA256 NSEC5 algorithm as follows:

   o  The VRF is the EC-VRF algorithm specified in [ID.goldbe-vrf]
      (Section X) where the secure hash function Hash is SHA-256 and the
      EC group G is the FIPS 186-3 P-256 curve.  SHA-256 is specified in
      [RFC6234].  The curve parameters are specified in [FIPS-186-3]
      (Section D.1.2.3) and [RFC5114] (Section 2.6).

   o  The public key format to be used in the NSEC5KEY RR is defined in
      Section 4 of [RFC6605] and thus is the same as the format used to
      store ECDSA public keys in DNSKEY RRs.

   This document defines the EC-ED25519-SHA256 NSEC5 algorithm as
   follows:

   o  The VRF is the EC-VRF algorithm specified in [ID.goldbe-vrf]
      (Section X) where the secure hash function Hash is SHA-256 and the
      EC group G is the Ed25519 curve.  SHA-256 is specified in
      [RFC6234].  The curve parameters are specified in [RFC7748]
      (Section 4.1).

   o  The public key format to be used in the NSEC5KEY RR is defined in
      Section 3 of [RFC8080] and thus is the same as the format used to
      store Ed25519 public keys in DNSKEY RRs.

5.  The NSEC5KEY Resource Record

   The NSEC5KEY RR stores a public NSEC5 key.  The key allows clients to
   validate an NSEC5 proof sent by a server.

5.1.  NSEC5KEY RDATA Wire Format

   The RDATA for the NSEC5KEY RR is as shown below:

                        1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Algorithm is a single octet identifying the NSEC5 algorithm.

   Public Key is a variable-sized field holding public key material for
   NSEC5 proof verification.

5.2.  NSEC5KEY RDATA Presentation Format

   The presentation format of the NSEC5KEY RDATA is as follows:

   The Algorithm field is represented as an unsigned decimal integer.

   The Public Key field is represented in Base64 encoding.  Whitespace
   is allowed within the Base64 text.

6.  The NSEC5 Resource Record

   The NSEC5 RR provides authenticated denial of existence for an RRset
   or domain name.  One NSEC5 RR represents one piece of an NSEC5 chain,
   proving existence of the owner name and non-existence of other domain
   names in the part of the hashed domain space that is covered until
   the next owner name hashed in the RDATA.

6.1.  NSEC5 RDATA Wire Format

   The RDATA for the NSEC5 RR is as shown below:

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The Key Tag field contains the key tag value of the NSEC5KEY RR that
   validates the NSEC5 RR, in network byte order.  The value is computed
   from the NSEC5KEY RDATA using the same algorithm used to compute key
   tag values for DNSKEY RRs.  This algorithm is defined in [RFC4034].

   The Flags field is a single octet.  The meaning of individual bits of
   the field is defined in Section 6.2.

   The Next Length field is an unsigned single octet specifying the
   length of the Next Hashed Owner Name field in octets.

   The Next Hashed Owner Name field is a sequence of binary octets.  It
   contains an NSEC5 hash of the next domain name in the NSEC5 chain.

   Type Bit Maps is a variable-sized field encoding RR types present at
   the original owner name matching the NSEC5 RR.  The format of the
   field is equivalent to the format used in the NSEC3 RR, described in
   [RFC5155].

6.2.  NSEC5 Flags Field

   The following one-bit NSEC5 flags are defined:

    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |           |W|O|
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

      O - Opt-Out flag

      W - Wildcard flag

   All the other flags are reserved for future use and MUST be zero.

   The Opt-Out flag has the same semantics as in NSEC3.  The definition
   and considerations in [RFC5155] are valid, except that NSEC3 is
   replaced by NSEC5.

   The Wildcard flag indicates that a wildcard synthesis is possible at
   the original domain name level (i.e., there is a wildcard node
   immediately descending from the immediate ancestor of the original
   domain name).  The purpose of the Wildcard flag is to reduce the
   maximum number of RRs required for an authenticated denial of
   existence proof from (at most) three to (at most) two, as originally
   described in [I-D.gieben-nsec4] Section 7.2.1.

6.3.  NSEC5 RDATA Presentation Format

   The presentation format of the NSEC5 RDATA is as follows:

   The Key Tag field is represented as an unsigned decimal integer.

   The Flags field is represented as an unsigned decimal integer.

   The Next Length field is not represented.

   The Next Hashed Owner Name field is represented as a sequence of
   case-insensitive Base32hex digits without any whitespace and without
   padding.

   The Type Bit Maps representation is equivalent to the representation
   used in NSEC3 RR, described in [RFC5155].

7.  The NSEC5PROOF Resource Record

   The NSEC5PROOF record is not to be included in the zone file.  The
   NSEC5PROOF record contains the NSEC5 proof, proving the position of
   the owner name in an NSEC5 chain.

7.1.  NSEC5PROOF RDATA Wire Format

   The RDATA for the NSEC5PROOF RR is shown below:

                        1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Key Tag field contains the key tag value of the NSEC5KEY RR that
   validates the NSEC5PROOF RR, in network byte order.

   Owner Name Hash is a variable-sized sequence of binary octets
   encoding the NSEC5 proof of the owner name of the RR.

7.2.  NSEC5PROOF RDATA Presentation Format

   The presentation format of the NSEC5PROOF RDATA is as follows:

   The Key Tag field is represented as an unsigned decimal integer.

   The Owner Name Hash is represented in Base64 encoding.  Whitespace is
   allowed within the Base64 text.

8.  Types of Authenticated Denial of Existence with NSEC5

   This section summarizes all possible types of authenticated denial of
   existence.  For each type the following lists are included:

   1.  Facts to prove: the minimum amount of information that an
       authoritative server must provide to a client to assure the
       client that the response content is valid.

   2.  Authoritative server proofs: the names for which the NSEC5PROOF
       RRs are synthesized and added into the response along the NSEC5
       RRs matching or covering each such name.  These records together
       prove the listed facts.

   3.  Validator checks: the individual checks that a validating server
       is required to perform on a response.  The response content is
       considered valid only if all of the checks pass.

   If NSEC5 is said to match a domain name, the owner name of the NSEC5
   RR has to be equivalent to an NSEC5 hash of that domain name.  If an
   NSEC5 RR is said to cover a domain name, the NSEC5 hash of the domain
   name must sort in canonical order between that NSEC5 RR's Owner Name
   and Next Hashed Owner Name.

8.1.  Name Error Responses

   Facts to prove:

      No RRset matching the QNAME exists.

      No RRset matching the QNAME via wildcard expansion exists.

      The QNAME does not fall into a delegation.

      The QNAME does not fall into a DNAME redirection.

   Authoritative server proofs:

      NSEC5PROOF for closest encloser and matching NSEC5 RR.

      NSEC5PROOF for next closer name and covering NSEC5 RR.

   Validator checks:

      Closest encloser is in the zone.

      Closest encloser does not have DNAME in the Type Bit Maps.

      Next closer name is derived correctly.

      Next closer name is not in the zone.

8.2.  No Data Responses

   The processing of a No Data response for DS QTYPE differs if the Opt-
   Out is in effect.  For DS QTYPE queries, the validator has two
   possible checking paths.  The correct path can be simply decided by
   inspecting if the NSEC5 RR in the response matches the QNAME.

   Note that the Opt-Out is valid only for DS QTYPE queries.

8.2.1.  No Data Response, Opt-Out Not In Effect

   Facts to prove:

      An RRset matching the QNAME exists.

      No QTYPE RRset matching the QNAME exists.

      No CNAME RRset matching the QNAME exists.

   Authoritative server proofs:

      NSEC5PROOF for the QNAME and matching NSEC5 RR.

   Validator checks:

      The QNAME is in the zone.

      Next closer name is not in the zone.

9.  Authoritative Server Considerations

9.1.  Zone Signing

   Zones using NSEC5 MUST satisfy the same properties as described in
   Section 7.1 of [RFC5155], with NSEC3 replaced by NSEC5.  In addition,
   the following conditions MUST be satisfied as well:

   o  If the original owner name has a wildcard label immediately
      descending from the original owner name, the corresponding NSEC5
      RR MUST have the Wildcard flag set in the Flags field.  Otherwise,
      the flag MUST be cleared.

   o  The zone apex MUST include an NSEC5KEY RRset containing a NSEC5
      public key allowing verification of the current NSEC5 chain.

   The following steps describe one possible method to properly add
   required NSEC5 related records into a zone.  This is not the only
   such existing method.

   1.  Select an algorithm for NSEC5.  Generate the public and private
       NSEC5 keys.

   2.  Add an NSEC5KEY RR into the zone apex containing the public NSEC5
       key.

   3.  For each unique original domain name in the zone and each empty
       non-terminal, add an NSEC5 RR.  If Opt-Out is used, owner names
       of unsigned delegations MAY be excluded.

Internet-Draft                    NSEC5                       March 2017


       A.  The owner name of the NSEC5 RR is the NSEC5 hash of the
       original owner name encoded in Base32hex without padding,
       prepended as a single label to the zone name.

       B.  Set the Key Tag field to be the key tag corresponding to the
       public NSEC5 key.

       C.  Clear the Flags field.  If Opt-Out is being used, set the
       Opt-Out flag.  If there is a wildcard label directly descending
       from the original domain name, set the Wildcard flag.  Note that
       the wildcard can be an empty non-terminal (i.e., the wildcard
       synthesis does not take effect and therefore the flag is not to
       be set).

       D.  Set the Next Length field to a value determined by the used
       NSEC5 algorithm.  Leave the Next Hashed Owner Name field blank.

       E.  Set the Type Bit Maps field based on the RRsets present at
       the original owner name.

   4.  Sort the set of NSEC5 RRs into canonical order.

   5.  For each NSEC5 RR, set the Next Hashed Owner Name field by using
       the owner name of the next NSEC5 RR in the canonical order.  If
       the updated NSEC5 is the last NSEC5 RR in the chain, the owner
       name of the first NSEC5 RR in the chain is used instead.

   The NSEC5KEY and NSEC5 RRs MUST have the same class as the zone SOA
   RR.  Also the NSEC5 RRs SHOULD have the same TTL value as the SOA
   minimum TTL field.

   Notice that a use of Opt-Out is not indicated in the zone.  This does
   not affect the ability of a server to prove insecure delegations.
   The Opt-Out MAY be part of the zone-signing tool configuration.

9.1.1.  Precomputing Closest Provable Encloser Proofs

   Per Section 8, the worst-case scenario when answering a negative
   query with NSEC5 requires authoritative server to respond with two
   NSEC5PROOF RRs and two NSEC5 RRs.  One pair of NSEC5PROOF and NSEC5
   RRs corresponds to the closest provable encloser, and the other pair
   corresponds to the next closer name.  The NSEC5PROOF corresponding to
   the next closer name MUST be computed on the fly by the authoritative
   server when responding to the query.  However, the NSEC5PROOF
   corresponding to the closest provable encloser MAY be precomputed and
   stored as part of zone signing.

Internet-Draft                    NSEC5                       March 2017


   Precomputing NSEC5PROOF RRs can halve the number of online
   cryptographic computations required when responding to a negative
   query.  NSEC5PROOF RRs MAY be precomputed as part of zone signing as
   follows: For each NSEC5 RR, compute an NSEC5PROOF RR corresponding to
   the original owner name of the NSEC5 RR.  The content of the
   precomputed NSEC5PROOF record MUST be the same as if the record was
   computed on the fly when serving the zone.  NSEC5PROOF records are
   not part of the zone and SHOULD be stored separately from the zone
   file.

9.2.  Zone Serving

   This specification modifies DNSSEC-enabled DNS responses generated by
   authoritative servers.  In particular, it replaces use of NSEC or
   NSEC3 RRs in such responses with NSEC5 RRs and adds NSEC5PROOF RRs.

   According to the type of a response, an authoritative server MUST
   include NSEC5 RRs in the response, as defined in Section 8.  For each
   NSEC5 RR in the response, a corresponding RRSIG RRset and an
   NSEC5PROOF MUST be added as well.  The NSEC5PROOF RR has its owner
   name set to the domain name required according to the description in
   Section 8.  The class and TTL of the NSEC5PROOF RR MUST be the same
   as the class and TTL value of the corresponding NSEC5 RR.  The RDATA
   payload of the NSEC5PROOF is set according to the description in
   Section 7.1.

   Notice that the NSEC5PROOF owner name can be a wildcard (e.g., source
   of synthesis proof in wildcard No Data responses).  The name also
   always matches the domain name required for the proof while the NSEC5
   RR may only cover (not match) the name in the proof (e.g., closest
   encloser in Name Error responses).

   If NSEC5 is used, an answering server MUST use exactly one NSEC5
   chain for one signed zone.

   NSEC5 MUST NOT be used in parallel with NSEC, NSEC3, or any other
   authenticated denial of existence mechanism that allows for
   enumeration of zone contents, as this would defeat a principal
   security goal of NSEC5.

   Similarly to NSEC3, the owner names of NSEC5 RRs are not represented
   in the NSEC5 chain and therefore NSEC5 records deny their own
   existence.  The desired behavior caused by this paradox is the same
   as described in Section 7.2.8 of [RFC5155].

9.3.  NSEC5KEY Rollover Mechanism

   Replacement of the NSEC5 key implies generating a new NSEC5 chain.
   The NSEC5KEY rollover mechanism is similar to "Pre-Publish Zone
   Signing Key Rollover" as specified in [RFC6781].  The NSEC5KEY
   rollover MUST be performed as a sequence of the following steps:

   1.  A new public NSEC5 key is added into the NSEC5KEY RRset in the
       zone apex.

   2.  The old NSEC5 chain is replaced by a new NSEC5 chain constructed
       using the new key.  This replacement MUST happen as a single
       atomic operation; the server MUST NOT be responding with RRs from
       both the new and old chain at the same time.

   3.  The old public key is removed from the NSEC5KEY RRset in the zone
       apex.

   The minimum delay between steps 1 and 2 MUST be the time it takes for
   the data to propagate to the authoritative servers, plus the TTL
   value of the old NSEC5KEY RRset.

   The minimum delay between steps 2 and 3 MUST be the time it takes for
   the data to propagate to the authoritative servers, plus the maximum
   zone TTL value of any of the data in the previous version of the
   zone.

9.4.  Secondary Servers

   This document does not define mechanism to distribute private NSEC5
   keys.  See Section 15.2 for security considerations for private NSEC5
   keys.

9.5.  Zones Using Unknown NSEC5 Algorithms

   Zones that are signed with an unknown NSEC5 algorithm or with an
   unavailable private NSEC5 key cannot be effectively served.  Such
   zones SHOULD be rejected when loading and servers SHOULD respond with
   RCODE=2 (Server failure) when handling queries that would fall under
   such zones.

9.6.  Dynamic Updates

   A zone signed using NSEC5 MAY accept dynamic updates [RFC2136].  The
   changes to the zone MUST be performed in a way that ensures that the
   zone satisfies the properties specified in Section 9.1 at any time.
   The process described in [RFC5155] Section 7.5 describes how to

Internet-Draft                    NSEC5                       March 2017


   handle the issues surrounding the handling of empty non-terminals as
   well as Opt-Out.

   It is RECOMMENDED that the server rejects all updates containing
   changes to the NSEC5 chain and its related RRSIG RRs, and performs
   itself any required alternations of the NSEC5 chain induced by the
   update.  Alternatively, the server MUST verify that all the
   properties are satisfied prior to performing the update atomically.

10.  Resolver Considerations

   The same considerations as described in Section 9 of [RFC5155] for
   NSEC3 apply to NSEC5.  In addition, as NSEC5 RRs can be validated
   only with appropriate NSEC5PROOF RRs, the NSEC5PROOF RRs MUST be all
   together cached and included in responses with NSEC5 RRs.

11.  Validator Considerations

11.1.  Validating Responses

   The validator MUST ignore NSEC5 RRs with Flags field values other
   than the ones defined in Section 6.2.

   The validator MAY treat responses as bogus if the response contains
   NSEC5 RRs that refer to a different NSEC5KEY.

   According to a type of a response, the validator MUST verify all
   conditions defined in Section 8.  Prior to making decision based on
   the content of NSEC5 RRs in a response, the NSEC5 RRs MUST be
   validated.

   To validate a denial of existence, public NSEC5 keys for the zone are
   required in addition to DNSSEC public keys.  Similarly to DNSKEY RRs,
   the NSEC5KEY RRs are present at the zone apex.

   The NSEC5 RR is validated as follows:

   1.  Select a correct public NSEC5 key to validate the NSEC5 proof.
       The Key Tag value of the NSEC5PROOF RR must match with the key
       tag value computed from the NSEC5KEY RDATA.

   2.  Validate the NSEC5 proof present in the NSEC5PROOF Owner Name
       Hash field using the public NSEC5 key.  If there are multiple
       NSEC5KEY RRs matching the key tag, at least one of the keys must
       validate the NSEC5 proof.

   3.  Compute the NSEC5 hash value from the NSEC5 proof and check if
       the response contains NSEC5 RR matching or covering the computed

       NSEC5 hash.  The TTL values of the NSEC5 and NSEC5PROOF RRs must
       be the same.

   4.  Validate the signature on the NSEC5 RR.

   If the NSEC5 RR fails to validate, it MUST be ignored.  If some of
   the conditions required for an NSEC5 proof are not satisfied, the
   response MUST be treated as bogus.

   Notice that determining the closest encloser and next closer name in
   NSEC5 is easier than in NSEC3.  NSEC5 and NSEC5PROOF RRs are always
   present in pairs in responses and the original owner name of the
   NSEC5 RR matches the owner name of the NSEC5PROOF RR.

11.2.  Validating Referrals to Unsigned Subzones

   The same considerations as defined in Section 8.9 of [RFC5155] for
   NSEC3 apply to NSEC5.

11.3.  Responses With Unknown NSEC5 Algorithms

   A validator MUST ignore NSEC5KEY RRs with unknown NSEC5 algorithms.
   The practical result of this is that zones signed with unknown
   algorithms will be considered bogus.

12.  Special Considerations

12.1.  Transition Mechanism

   [TODO: The following information will be covered.]

   o  Transition to NSEC5 from NSEC/NSEC3

   o  Transition from NSEC5 to NSEC/NSEC3

   o  Transition to new NSEC5 algorithms

12.2.  Private NSEC5 keys

   This document does not define a format to store private NSEC5 keys.
   Use of a standardized and adopted format is RECOMMENDED.

   The private NSEC5 key MAY be shared between multiple zones, however a
   separate key is RECOMMENDED for each zone.

Internet-Draft                    NSEC5                       March 2017


12.3.  Domain Name Length Restrictions

   NSEC5 creates additional restrictions on domain name lengths.  In
   particular, zones with names that, when converted into hashed owner
   names, exceed the 255 octet length limit imposed by [RFC1035] cannot
   use this specification.

   The actual maximum length of a domain name depends on the length of
   the zone name and the NSEC5 algorithm used.

   All NSEC5 algorithms defined in this document use 256-bit NSEC5 hash
   values.  Such a value can be encoded in 52 characters in Base32hex
   without padding.  When constructing the NSEC5 RR owner name, the
   encoded hash is prepended to the name of the zone as a single label
   which includes the length field of a single octet.  The maximum
   length of the zone name in wire format using the 256-bit hash is
   therefore 202 octets (255 - 53).

13.  Implementation Status

   NSEC5 has been implemented for the Knot DNS authoritative server
   (version 1.6.4) and the Unbound recursive server (version 1.5.9).
   The implementations did not introduce additional library
   dependencies; all cryptographic primitives are already present in
   OpenSSL v1.0.2j, which is used by both implementations.  The
   implementations support the full spectrum of negative responses,
   (i.e., NXDOMAIN, NODATA, Wildcard, Wildcard NODATA, and unsigned
   delegation) using the EC-P256-SHA256 algorithm.  The code is
   deliberately modular, so that the EC-ED25519-SHA256 algorithm could
   be implemented by using the Ed25519 elliptic curve [RFC8080] as a
   drop-in replacement for the P256 elliptic curve.  The authoritative
   server implements the optimization from Section 9.1.1 to precompute
   the NSEC5PROOF RRs matching each NSEC5 record.

14.  Performance Considerations

   The performance of NSEC5 has been evaluated in [nsec5ecc].

15.  Security Considerations

15.1.  Zone Enumeration Attacks

   NSEC5 is robust to zone enumeration via offline dictionary attacks by
   any attacker that does not know the private NSEC5 key.  Without the
   private NSEC5 key, that attacker cannot compute the NSEC5 proof that
   corresponds to a given domain name.  The only way it can learn the
   NSEC5 proof value for a domain name is by querying the authoritative
   server for that name.  Without the NSEC5 proof value, the attacker



Vcelak, et al.         Expires September 10, 2017              [Page 21]

Internet-Draft                    NSEC5                       March 2017


   cannot learn the NSEC5 hash value.  Thus, even an attacker that
   collects the entire chain of NSEC5 RR for a zone cannot use offline
   attacks to "reverse" that NSEC5 hash values in these NSEC5 RR and
   thus learn which names are present in the zone.  A formal
   cryptographic proof of this property is in [nsec5] and [nsec5ecc].

15.2.  Compromise of the Private NSEC5 Key

   NSEC5 requires authoritative servers to hold the private NSEC5 key,
   but not the private zone-signing keys or the private key-signing keys
   for the zone.

   The private NSEC5 key cannot be used to modify zone contents, because
   zone contents are signed using the private zone-signing key.  As
   such, a compromise of the private NSEC5 key does not compromise the
   integrity of the zone.  An adversary that learns the private NSEC5
   key can, however, perform offline zone-enumeration attacks.  For this
   reason, the private NSEC5 key need only be as secure as the DNSSEC
   records whose privacy (against zone enumeration) is being protected
   by NSEC5.  A formal cryptographic proof of this property is in
   [nsec5] and [nsec5ecc].

   To preserve this property of NSEC5, the private NSEC5 key MUST be
   different from the private zone-signing keys or key-signing keys for
   the zone.

15.3.  Key Length Considerations

   The NSEC5 key must be long enough to withstand attacks for as long as
   the privacy of the zone contents is important.  Even if the NSEC5 key
   is rolled frequently, its length cannot be too short, because zone
   privacy may be important for a period of time longer than the
   lifetime of the key.  For example, an attacker might collect the
   entire chain of NSEC5 RR for the zone over one short period, and
   then, later (even after the NSEC5 key expires) perform an offline
   dictionary attack that attempts to reverse the NSEC5 hash values
   present in the NSEC5 RRs.  This is in contrast to zone-signing and
   key-signing keys used in DNSSEC; these keys, which ensure the
   authenticity and integrity of the zone contents, need to remain
   secure only during their lifetime.

15.4.  NSEC5 Hash Collisions

   If the NSEC5 hash of a QNAME collides with the NSEC5 hash of the
   owner name of an NSEC5 RR, it will be impossible to prove the non-
   existence of the colliding QNAME.  However, the NSEC5 VRFs ensure
   that obtaining such a collision is as difficult as obtaining a
   collision in the SHA-256 hash function, requiring approximately 2^128

   effort.  Note that DNSSEC already relies on the assumption that a
   cryptographic hash function is collision-resistant, since these hash
   functions are used for generating and validating signatures and DS
   RRs.  See also the discussion on key lengths in [nsec5].

16.  IANA Considerations

   This document updates the IANA registry "Domain Name System (DNS)
   Parameters" in subregistry "Resource Record (RR) TYPEs", by defining
   the following new RR types:

      NSEC5KEY value TBD.

      NSEC5 value TBD.

      NSEC5PROOF value TBD.

   This document creates a new IANA registry for NSEC5 algorithms.  This
   registry is named "DNSSEC NSEC5 Algorithms".  The initial content of
   the registry is:

      0 is Reserved.

      1 is EC-P256-SHA256.

      2 is EC-ED25519-SHA256.

      3-255 is Available for assignment.

   This document updates the IANA registry "DNS Security Algorithm
   Numbers" by defining following aliases:

      TBD is NSEC5-ECDSAP256SHA256 alias for ECDSAP256SHA256 (13).

      TBD is NSEC5-ED25519, alias for ED25519 (15).

   of NSEC5, and assisted with evaluating its performance.

Appendix A.  Examples

   We use small DNS zone with three names and four types (SOA, NS, A,
   and TXT) to illustrate how denying responses are handled with NSEC5.
   For brevity, the class is not shown (defaults to IN) and the SOA
   record is shortened, resulting in the following zone file:

      example.org.  SOA ( ... )

      example.org.  NS a.example.org.

      c.example.org.  A 192.0.2.1

      c.example.org.  TXT "c record"

      g.example.org.  A 192.0.2.1

      g.example.org.  TXT "g record"

      *.a.example.org.  TXT "wildcard record"

A.1.  Name Error Example

   Consider a query for a type A record for a.b.c.example.org.

   The server must prove the following facts:

   o  Existence of closest encloser c.example.org.

   o  Non-existence of wildcard at closest encloser *.c.example.org.

   o  Non-existence of next closer b.c.example.org.

   To do this, the server returns:

   o  An NSEC5PROOF RR for c.example.com and a signed NSEC5 RR
      "matching" c.example.org its with Wildcard flag cleared.  (Note:
      the "matching" NSEC5 RR has its owner name equal to the NSEC5 hash
      of c.example.org.)  Per Section 9.1.1, this NSEC5PROOF RR may be
      precomputed.  NSEC5 RRs are always precomputed.

   o  An NSEC5PROOF RR for b.c.example.org and a signed NSEC5 RR
      "covering" b.c.example.org (The NSEC5 hash of b.c.example.org
      sorts in canonical order between the "covering" NSEC5 RR's Owner
      Name and Next Hashed Owner Name.)  This
      NSEC5PROOF RR must be computed on-the-fly.  NSEC5 RRs are always
      precomputed.

A.2.  No Data Example, Opt-Out Not In Effect

   Consider a query for a type MX record for c.example.org.

      NSEC5 hash of c.example.org.)  Per Section 9.1.1, this NSEC5PROOF
      RR may be precomputed.  NSEC5 RRs are always precomputed.

A.3.  No Data Example, Opt-Out In Effect

   [Sharon has no idea how to make such an example.  Jan, want to try?]

A.4.  Wildcard Example

   [Sharon is not sure this is correct.  Please check my work!]

   Consider a query for a type TXT record for foo.a.example.org.

   The server must prove the following facts:

   o  Existence of the TXT record for the wildcard *.a.example.org

   o  Non-existence of the next closer name foo.a.example.org.

   To do this, the server returns:

   o  A signed TXT record for *.a.example.org.  [Garr this is not
      exactly correct its the crazy DNSSEC label match thing.  But its a
      distraction here...! Maybe we should just cite the RFC that shows
      how to do this.  If someone knows what RFC that is, please go
      ahead and cite it.]

   o  An NSEC5PROOF RR for foo.a.example.com and a signed NSEC5 RR
      "covering" foo.a.example.com.  (The NSEC5 hash of
      foo.a.example.org sorts in canonical order between the "covering"

      "matching" c.example.org its with its Wildcard flag set and its
      CNAME and MX Type Bits cleared.  (Note: the "matching" NSEC5 RR
      has its owner name equal to the NSEC5 hash of a.example.org.)  Per
      Section 9.1.1, this NSEC5PROOF RR may be precomputed.  NSEC5 RRs
      are always precomputed.

   o  An NSEC5PROOF RR for foo.a.example.com and a signed NSEC5 RR
      "covering" foo.a.example.com.  (The NSEC5 hash of
      foo.a.example.org sorts in canonical order between the "covering"
      NSEC5 RR's Owner Name and Next Hashed Owner Name.)  This
      NSEC5PROOF RR must be computed on-the-fly.  NSEC5 RRs are always
      precomputed.

Appendix B.  Change Log

   Note to RFC Editor: if this document does not obsolete an existing
   RFC, please remove this appendix before publication as an RFC.

      pre 00 - initial version of the document submitted to mailing list
      only

      00 - fix NSEC5KEY rollover mechanism, clarify NSEC5PROOF RDATA,
      clarify inputs and outputs for NSEC5 proof and NSEC5 hash
      computation.
