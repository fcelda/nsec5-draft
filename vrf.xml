       <t>
        A Verifiable Random Function (VRF) is the public-key version of a
        keyed cryptographic hash. Only the holder of the private key
        can compute the hash, but anyone with public key
        can verify the correctness of the hash.    
        VRFs are useful for preventing enumeration of hash-based data structures.
        This document specifies several VRF constructions that are secure in
        the cryptographic random oracle model. One  VRF uses RSA and the other
        VRF uses Eliptic Curves (EC).

        <section title="Rationale">

    <t>
   A Verifiable Random Function
   (VRF) <xref target="MRV99"></xref> is the public-key version of a
   keyed cryptographic hash. Only the holder of the private VRF key
   can compute the hash, but anyone with corresponding public key
   can verify the correctness of the hash.
   </t>

   <t>
   A key application of the VRF is to provide privacy against 
   offline enumeration (e.g. dictionary attacks) on data  stored in a 
   hash-based data structure. 
   In this application, a Prover holds the VRF private key and uses the VRF hashing to
   construct a hash-based data structure on the input data.

   Due to the nature of the VRF, only the Prover can answer queries
   about whether or not some data is stored in the data structure.  Anyone who
   knows the public VRF key can verify that the Prover has answered the queries
   correctly. However no offline inferences (i.e. inferences without querying
   the Prover) can be made about the data stored in the data strucuture.

   <section title="VRF Algorithms">
   
   <t>
   A VRF comes with a key generation algorithm that generates a public VRF 
   key PK and private VRF key SK. 
   </t>
   
   <t>
   The prover hashes an input alpha using the private VRF key SK to obtain a VRF
   hash output beta
    <list>
    <t> beta = VRF_hash(SK, alpha) </t>
    </list>
   The VRF_hash algorithm is deterministic, in 
   the sense that it always produces the same output beta given a 
   pair of inputs (SK, alpha).
      
   The prover also uses the private key SK to construct a
   proof pi that beta is the correct hash output 
   <list>
        <t>pi = VRF_prove(SK, alpha)</t>
   </list>
   The VRFs defined in this document allow anyone to deterministically
   obtain the VRF hash output beta directly from the proof value pi as
   <list>
   <t> beta = VRF_proof_to_hash(pi)</t>
   </list>
   Notice that this means that 
   <list>
   <t> VRF_hash(SK, alpha) = VRF_proof_to_hash(VRF_prove(SK, alpha))</t>
   </list>
   and thus this document will specify VRF_prove and VRF_proof_to_hash
   rather than VRF_hash.
   </t>
   
   <t>
   The proof pi allows a Verifier holding the public key PK
   to verify that beta is the correct VRF hash of input alpha
   under key PK. Thus, the VRF also comes with an algorithm
   <list>
   <t>   VRF_verify(PK, alpha, pi)</t>
   </list>
   that outputs VALID if pi was correctly produced,
   and outputs INVALID otherwise.
   </t>   
   </section>
   
   
   <section title="VRF Security Properties" anchor="secdef">
    
    <t> VRFs are designed to ensure the following security properties.
   </t>
   
   
   <section title= "Full Uniqueness or Trusted Uniqueness">
	
    <t> Uniqueness means that, for any fixed public
	VRF key and for any input alpha, there is a unique VRF
	output beta that can be proved to be valid.  Uniqueness must hold
    even for an adversarial Prover that knows the VRF private key SK.
    </t>

    <t>
    More precisely, "full uniqueness" states that a computationally-bounded adversary cannot
	choose 
    a VRF public key PK, 
    a VRF input alpha, 
    and two proofs pi1 and pi2 such that
    VRF_verify(PK, alpha, pi1)
    and VRF_verify(PK, alpha, pi2)
	both output VALID, and VRF_proof_to_hash(pi1) is not equal to VRF_proof_to_hash(pi2).
    </t>
    
    <t>
     A slightly weaker security
     property called "trusted uniqueness" sufficies for many applications.
     Trusted uniqueness is the same as full uniqueness, but it must hold 
     only if the VRF keys PK and SK were generated in a trustworthy 
     manner. In other words, uniqueness might not hold if keys were
     generated in an invalid manner or with bad randomness.
	</t>
	</section>

	<section title="Full Collison Resistance or Trusted Collision Resistance">

    <t>Like any cryprographic hash function, VRFs need to be
        collision resistant.  Collison resistance must hold
    even for an adversarial Prover that knows the VRF private key SK.
    </t>
    
    <t> More precisely, "full collision resistance" states that
        it should be computationally 
        infeasible for an adversary to find two distinct VRF
	    inputs alpha1 and alpha2 that have the same VRF hash beta, 
        even if that adversary knows the private VRF key SK.
    </t>
    
    <t>
	    For most applications, a slightly weaker security property
        called "trusted collision resistance" suffices. 
        Trusted collision resistance is the same as collision resistance, 
        but it holds only if PK and SK were generated in a trustworthy manner.
    </t>
   </section>


    <section title="Full Pseudorandomness or Selective Pseudorandomness" anchor="pseudodef">
    
    <t> Pseudorandomness ensures that when an adversarial Verifier sees 
        a VRF hash output beta without its corresponding VRF proof pi, 
        then beta is indistinguishable from a random value.
    </t>
    
    <t>  More precisely, suppose the public and private VRF keys (PK, SK) were generated
	     in a trustworthy manner.
	     Pseudorandomness ensures that the VRF hash output beta
         (without its corresponding VRF proof pi) on
	     any adversarially-chosen "target" VRF input alpha
	     looks indistinguishable from random
	     for any computationally bounded adversary who does not know the private
         VRF key SK.  This holds even if the adversary also gets to 
         choose other VRF inputs alpha' and observe their corresponding 
         VRF hash outputs beta' and proofs pi'.
    </t>
    
    <t>   
         With "full pseudorandomness", the adversary is allowed to choose the 
         "target" VRF input  alpha at any time, even after it observes VRF outputs beta'
         and proofs pi' on a variety of chosen inputs alpha'.
         </t>
         
         <t>
         "Selective pseudorandomness" is a weaker security property
         which suffices in many applications. Here, the adversary must choose
         the target VRF input alpha independently of the public VRF key PK,
         and before it  observes VRF outputs beta'
         and proofs pi' on inputs alpha' of its choice.
	     </t>
         
	<t> 
	   It is important to remember that the VRF output beta does not 
	   look random to the Prover, or to any other party that knows the private 
       VRF key SK!  Such a party can easily distinguish beta from 
       a random value by comparing beta to the result of VRF_hash(SK, alpha).	     
	</t>

	<t> Also, the VRF output beta does not look random to any party that
	knows valid VRF proof pi corresponding to the VRF input alpha, even
	if this party does not know the private VRF key SK.
	Such a party can easily distinguish beta from a random value by
    checking whether VRF_verify(PK, alpha, pi) returns "VALID" and
    beta = VRF_proof_to_hash(pi).
	</t>

    
	<t>
    Also, the VRF output beta may not look random if VRF key generation
    was not done in a trustworthy fashion. (For example, if VRF keys were 
    generated with bad randomness.)
	</t>

   </section>
   
   <section title="A random-oracle-like unpredictability property">
   
   <t>[TODO:   This property is not needed for applications
   that use VRFs to prevent enumeration of hash-based data structures.
   However, we noticed that some other applications of VRF 
   (e.g. Algorand, Oroborus) rely on 
   this property.  We are waiting on a formal definition 
   of this property in the literature, and a proof that our ECVRF scheme
   can satisfy this property. 
   Preliminary analysis suggests that acheiving this property
   requires ECVRF verifiers to run an VRF_validate_key() key function upon receipt
   of VRF public keys and the proof_to_hash function to be modified to take in
   (Gamma, beta, pk) rather than just Gamma.]</t>
      
   <t>Pseudorandomness, as defined in <xref target="pseudodef"/>, does not 
   hold if the VRF keys were generated adversarially. For instance, if an adversary outputs VRF keys that are deterministically generated (or hard-coded and publicly known), then the outputs are easily derived by anyone.
   </t>
   
   <t>There is, however, a different type of unpredictability that could hold
   even if the VRF keys are generated adversarially, as long as 
   the VRF input alpha is unpredictable.  This property is similar
   to the unpredictability achieved by an (ordinary, unkeyed)
   cryptographic hash function: if the input has enough entropy (i.e., cannot be predicted), then the output is indistinguishable
   from uniform.
   </t>
   <t>
       The ECVRF scheme presented in this specification satisfies this property if the public key satisfies the key validation
   procedure in <xref target="keycheck"/>.</t>

    <section title="RSA Full Domain Hash VRF (RSA-FDH-VRF)" anchor="fdh">
        <t>
            The RSA Full Domain Hash  VRF (RSA-FDH-VRF) is a VRF that satisfies
            the "trusted uniqueness", "trusted
            collision resistance", and "full pseudorandomness" properties defined in <xref target="secdef"/>.
            Its security follows from the
            standard RSA assumption in the random oracle model.  Formal
            security proofs are in <xref target="nsec5ecc" />.  
        </t>

        <t>
            The VRF computes the proof pi as a deterministic RSA signature on
            input alpha using the RSA Full Domain Hash Algorithm
            <xref target="RFC8017" /> parametrized with the selected hash algorithm.
            RSA signature verification is used to verify the correctness of the
            proof. The VRF hash output beta is simply obtained by hashing 
            the proof pi with the selected hash algorithm.

            The Elliptic Curve Verifiable Random Function (ECVRF) is a VRF that
            satisfies the trusted uniqueness, trusted collision resistance,
            and full pseudorandomness properties defined in <xref target="secdef"/>.
            The security of this VRF follows from the decisional 
            Diffie-Hellman (DDH) assumption in the random oracle model. Formal security proofs are
            in <xref target="nsec5ecc" />.  
        </t>
        
        <t> To additionally satisfy "full uniqueness" and "full collision resistance", 
        the Verifier MUST additionally perform the validation procedure specified in 
        <xref target="keycheck"/>  upon receipt of the public
        VRF key.

                <t> In order to make this algorithm run in time that is (almost) independent
                    of the input alpha_string (so-called "constant-time"), implementers should pay particular attention
                    to Steps 12 and 13 above.
                    These steps can be implemented using the following approach:
                <list>
                    <t> e = w ^ ((p-1)/2) mod p</t>
                    <t>final_u = (e*u + (e-1) * (A/2)) mod p</t>
                </list>
                The first step will produce a value e that is either 1 or p-1 (it is guaranteed not to be any other value, because w is guaranteed to be nonzero). Implementers should also ensure that the second step
                runs in the same amount of time regardless of e by ensuring that
                arithmetic in constant time.
                </t>
                
                <t>
                Alternatively, let CMOV(result_if_1, result_if_0, selector) be the function that returns result_if_1 when
                selector is 1 and  result_if_0 when selector is 0. If CMOV is implemented in constant time, then steps 12 and 13 above can be implemented as follows:
                <list>
                    <t>e = (w^((p-1)/2))+1 mod p</t>
                    <t>b = e/2</t>
                    <t>other_u = (-A-u) mod p</t>
                    <t>final_u = CMOV(u, other_u, b)</t>
                </list>
                (Note that after the first step, e is either 0 or 2, and only the least significant byte of e is needed in the second step).
                CMOV can be implemented in constant time a variety of ways; for example, by expanding b from a single bit to an all-0 or all-1 string (accomplished by negating b in standard two's-complement arithmetic) and then applying bitwise XOR and AND operations as follows: other_x XOR ((x XOR other_x) AND b)
                </t>
                <t>
                    If having this algorithm run in constant time is not important, then there are much faster algorithms
                    to compute the Legendre symbol (which is the same as the Jacobi symbol because p is a prime).
                    See, for example, Section 12.3 of <xref target="ntb"/>.

                    CMOV can be implemented in constant time a variety of ways; for example, by expanding b from a single bit to an all-0 or all-1 string (accomplished by negating b in standard two's-complement arithmetic) and then applying bitwise XOR and AND operations as follows: other_x XOR ((x XOR other_x) AND b)

                    If having this algorithm run in constant time is not important, then there are much faster algorithms

            </t>
            <t>Note that if the cofactor = 1, then Step 3 need not multiply Y by the cofactor; instead, it suffices
                to output "INVALID" if Y is the point at infinity. Moreover, if the cofactor is small, the total number
                of points that could cause Step 3 to output "INVALID" may be small, and it may be more efficient to simply
                check Y against a fixed list of such points. For example, the following algorithm can be used for the Ed25519 curve:

        <t>
            An implementation of the RSA-FDH-VRF (SHA-256) and ECVRF-P256-SHA256 was
            first developed
            as a part of the NSEC5 project <xref target="I-D.vcelak-nsec5" /> and is available
            at <eref target="http://github.com/fcelda/nsec5-crypto" />. 
            The ECVRF implementation may be out of date as this spec has evolved.
        </t>
    
    <t>
    The Key Transparency project at Google
    uses a VRF implemention that is similar to
    the ECVRF-P256-SHA256, with a few minor changes
    including the use of SHA-512 instead of SHA-256. Its implementation
    is available <eref target="https://github.com/google/keytransparency/blob/master/core/vrf/vrf.go" />
    </t>
    
    
    <t>
    An implementation by Yahoo! similar to the ECVRF is available at
    <eref target="https://github.com/r2ishiguro/vrf"/>.

    Open Whisper Systems also uses a VRF very similar to 
    ECVRF-ED25519-SHA512-Elligator, called VXEdDSA, and specified here:

    <section title="Security Considerations" anchor="securitycons">


    <section title="Key Generation">

    <t>Applications that use the VRFs defined in this
    document MUST ensure that that the VRF key is generated correctly,
    using good randomness.
    </t>
    
    <section title="Uniqueness and collision resistance with untrusted keys">
        
    <t>The ECVRF as specified in <xref target="ecvrfprove"/>-<xref target="suites"/>
    statisfies the "trusted uniqueness" and "trusted collision resistance" properties
    as long as the VRF keys are generated correctly, with good randomness.
    If the Verifier trusts the VRF keys are generated correctly, it MAY use 
    the public key Y as is.
    </t>
    
    <t>
    However, if the ECVRF uses keys that could be generated adversarially, then the
    the Verfier MUST first perform the validation procedure ECVRF_validate_key(PK)
    (specified in <xref target="keycheck"/>)  upon receipt of the
    public key PK as an octet string.  If the validation procedure
    outputs "INVALID", then the public key MUST not be used.  
    Otherwise, the procedure will output a valid public key Y,
    and the ECVRF with public key Y satisfies the "full uniqueness" and
    "full collision resistance" properties.
    </t>
    
    
    <t>The RSA-FDH-VRF statisfies the "trusted uniqueness" and "trusted collision resistance" properties
    as long as the VRF keys are generated correctly, with good randomness.
    These properties may not hold if the keys are generated adversarially  
    (e.g., if RSA is not permutation). Meanwhile, 
    the "full uniqueness" and "full collision resistance" are 
    properties that hold  even if VRF keys are generated by an adversary.
    The RSA-FDH-VRF defined in this document does not have these properties.
    However, if adversarial key generation is a concern, the
    RSA-FDH-VRF may be modifed to have these 
    properties by adding additional cryptographic checks
    that its public key has the right form.  These modifications are left for future specification.
    </t>
    
    </section>
    
    <section title="Pseudorandomness with untrusted keys">
    
    <t> Without good randomness, the "pseudorandomness"
    properties of the VRF may not hold. Note that it is not possible to guarantee 
    pseudorandomness in the face of adversarially generated VRF keys.  This is
    because an adversary can always use bad randomness to generate the VRF keys, 
    and thus, the VRF output may not be pseudorandom.
    </t>
    </section>
    </section>


    
    <section title="Selective vs Full Pseudorandomness">
    
    <t><xref target="nsec5ecc"/> presents cryptographic reductions to an 
    underlying hard problem (e.g. Decisional Diffie Hellman for the ECVRF, or the
    standard RSA assumption for RSA-FDH-VRF) that prove the VRFs specificied in this 
    document possess full pseudorandomness
    as well as selective pseudorandomness. 
    However, the cryptographic reductions are tighter for selective
    pseudorandomness than for full pseudorandomness.  This means the 
    the VRFs have quantitavely stronger security 
    guarentees for selective pseudorandomness. 
    </t>
    
    <t> Applications that are concerned about tightness of cryptographic
    reductions therefore have two options.
    
    <list style="symbols">
    <t> They may choose to ensure that selective pseudorandomness is sufficient for
    the application. That is, that
	pseudorandomness of outputs matters only for inputs that are chosen
    independently of the VRF key. 
    </t>
    <t>If full pseudorandomness is required for the application, the application
    may increase
    security parameters to make up for the loose security reduction. 
    For RSA-FDH-VRF, this means increasing the RSA key length. For 
    ECVRF, this means increasing the cryptographic strength of the EC group
    G. For both RSA-FDH-VRF and ECVRF the cryptographic strength of the
    hash function Hash may also potentially need to be increased.
    </t>
    </list>
    </t>
    </section>


 <section title="Proper pseudorandom nonce for ECVRF">

    <t>
    The security of the ECVRF defined in this document relies on the 
    fact that nonce k used in the ECVRF_prove algorithm is
    chosen uniformly and pseudorandomly modulo q, and is unknown to the advesrary.
    Otherwise, an adversary may be able to recover
    the private VRF key x (and thus break pseudorandomness of the VRF)
    after observing several valid VRF proofs pi. The nonce generation methods
    specified in the ECVRF ciphersuites of <xref target="suites"/>
    are designed with this requirement in mind.
    </t>
    
    </section>
 
  <section title="Side-channel attacks">
    
    <t>Side channel attacks on cryptographic primatives are an important issue.
    Here we discuss only one such side channel:  timing attacks that can 
    be used to leak information about the VRF input alpha.  Implementers should
    take care to avoid side-channel attacks that leak information about 
    the VRF private key SK (and the nonce k used in the ECVRF).</t>
        
    <t>The ECVRF_hash_to_curve_try_and_increment algorithm defined in
    <xref target="ecvrfH2C1" /> SHOULD NOT be used in applications where
    the VRF input alpha is secret and is hashed by the VRF on-the-fly.
    This is because the algorithm's running time depends
    on the VRF input alpha, and thus creates a timing channel that
    can be used to learn information about alpha. 
    That said, for most inputs the amount of information obtained from
    such a timing attack is likely to be small (1 bit, on average), since the algorithm 
    is expected to find a valid curve point after only two attempts.  
    However, there might be inputs which cause the algorithm to make many attempts
    before it finds a valid curve point; for such inputs, the information leaked
    in a timing attack will be more than 1 bit. 
    </t>

    
    <t>Meanwhile, ECVRF-ED25519-SHA512-Elligator2 runs in time constant in alpha 
    if the implementation of the ECVRF_hash_to_curve function
    specified in <xref target="elligator2"/> also runs in constant time.
    </t>
    
    
  </section>

<section title="Proofs Provide No Secrecy for VRF Input">
    <t>The VRF proof pi is not designed to provide secrecy and, in general, 
        may reveal the VRF input alpha.
        Anyone who knows PK and pi is able to perform an offline
        dictionary attack to search for alpha, by verifying guesses for alpha using VRF_verify.
        This is in contrast to the VRF hash output beta which, without the proof, is pseudorandom
        and thus is designed to reveal no information about alpha.
    </t>
</section>

<section title="Prehashing" anchor="prehash" >
    <t>The VRFs specified in this document allow for read-once access to
        the input alpha for both signing and verifying. Thus, additional 
        prehashing of alpha (as specified, for example, in
        <xref target="RFC8032" /> for EdDSA signatures) is not needed, 
        even for applications that need to handle long alpha or
        to support the
        Initialized-Update-Finalize (IUF) interface (in such an interface,
        alpha is not supplied
        all at once, but rather in pieces by a sequence of calls to Update).
        The ECVRF, in particular, uses alpha only in
        ECVRF_hash_to_curve. The curve point H becomes the representative
        of alpha thereafter. Note that the suite_string octet and the public key
        are hashed together with alpha in ECVRF_hash_to_curve, which ensures
        that the curve (including the generator B) and the public
    key are included indirectly into subsequent hashes.</t>
</section>
 
 
 <section title="Hash function domain separation and future-proofing">
     <t>
         Hashing is used for different purposes in the two VRFs (namely, in the RSA-FDH-VRF, in MGF1 and in proof_to_hash; in the ECVRF, in hash_to_curve, nonce_generation, hash_points, and proof_to_hash). The
         theoretical analysis assumes each of these functions is a separate random oracle.
         This analysis still holds even if the same hash function is used, as long as the four 
         queries made to the hash function for a given SK and alpha are overwhelmingly unlikely 
         to equal each other or to any queries made to the hash function for the same SK and 
         different alpha. This is indeed the case for the RSA-FDH-VRF defined in this document, because the first octets
         of the input to the hash function used in MGF1 and in proof_to_hash are different.
         This is also the case for the ECVRF ciphersuites defined in this document, because:
         <list style="symbols">
          <t>inputs to the hash function used during nonce_generation are unlikely to equal 
          to inputs given to hash_to_curve, proof_to_hash, and hash_points. This
          follows since nonce_generation inputs a secret to the hash function that is not used by 
          honest parties as input to any other hash function, and is not available to the adversary</t>
          <t>the second octet of the input to the hash function used in 
          hash_to_curve, proof_to_hash, and
          hash_points are all different</t>
         </list>
         
     </t>
     
     <t>For the RSA VRF, if future designs need to specify variants of the design in this document, such variants should use different first octets in inputs to MGF1 and to the hash funciton used in proof_to_hash, in order to avoid the possibility
         that an adversary can obtain a VRF output under one variant, and then claim it was obtained under
         another variant
     </t>
     <t>For the elliptic curve VRF, if future designs need to specify variants (e.g., additional ciphersuites) of the design in this document,
         then, to avoid the possibility
         that an adversary can obtain a VRF output under one variant, and then claim it was obtained under
         another variant,
        they should specify a different suite_string constant. This way, the inputs
        to the hash_to_curve hash function used in producing H are
        guaranteed to be different; since all the other hashing done by the prover
        depends on H, inputs all the hash functions used by the prover will also be
        different as long as hash_to_curve is collision resistant.
